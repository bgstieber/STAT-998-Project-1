(A) Missing Data Notes:

FA.length (not that important, Standing.Height is actually a better measurement)
ID: 13 - 1 missing value
	+ missing from first measurement, no big deal
ID: 23 - all missing
ID: 47 - all missing
ID: 156 - 1 missing value
	+ missing value for first measurement after menarche
	+ might not want to replace that one


Sub-head:
No missing data

For Radius responses:
ID: 13 - 1 missing value
	+ missing from first measurement, no big deal
ID: 23 - all missing
ID: 47 - all missing
ID: 156 - 1 missing value
	+ missing value for first measurement after menarche
	+ might not want to replace that one

For Hip responses:
ID: 19 - 1 missing value
	+ missing from eighth measurement - mean replace looks good
ID: 146 - 1 missing value (not missing for Femoral.Neck.BMC.Hip)
	+ missing value for first measurement after menarche
	+ might not want to replace that one

Spine BMC:
No missing data

(B) Approaches for Aim 1 - 3:

Considered using the lagged dependent variable, but the time between measurements
is not constant, so we shouldn't do that.

Should we consider fitting models on subsets of the data w/r/t menarche date?
added 10/6: NO! Not really measuring what we're interested in.
(1) fit on data with females pre-menarche
(2) fit on data with females post-menarche
(3) fit on data with females no more than 2.5 years after menarche

For each aim, we fit basically the same model. We could say something in the write up about why we chose to not transform:
 - The distributions of the responses were fairly symmetric and normal. We thought it was better to keep on the base scale
   because it makes interpretation easier.
We can also say why we used cubic polynomial rather than a spline or a simple linear term
- It was apparent that there was significant curvature in the relationship between age and the
  response variables. Rather than using a non parametric technique like a spline model,
  we opted for including linear, quadratic, and cubic terms for men age at dxa. Not only does
  this higher orderd polynomial allow us to fit a curve, it also gives us the flexibility to fit
  random slope terms for each of the components of the age curve, since it is very likely that
  the rate of development (wrt age) differs from subject to subject.

Aim 1: Investigate the contribution of gymnastics to the bone development for early adults
	- Fit the same model on each response variable
	- Variable of interest: dummy variable for gymnastics participation?
	- Investigate the coefficients for each model
		- Are they significant?
		- Are the predicted values higher for gymnastics?


Aim 2: Investigate the contribution of early gymnastics to the bone development in the late stage 
(after one quits the gymnastics)
	- I think we'll need to play with the data a bit here
		+ Maybe create an independent variable measuring time since they quit gymnastics?
		+ Categorical variable describing stage
			- In gym _or_ Quit gym _or_ Never in gym?

Subset the data (only NON and PERI)
Fit regression using Group_Label2 (Quit, Never, In Gymnastics)
If Never is base level, investigate beta1 (coefficient for In Gym) and beta2 (coefficient for Quit)
Also compare beta1 and beta2
Possibly interact with menarcheal age at DXA ?


Aim 3: Investigate whether the contributions of gymnastics are different to the development of bones
in different regions
	- Repeat analysis for part 1, but this time use centered and scaled
	  dependent variables (zero mean, unit variance)
	- we'll also need to make sure we fit each model on the __same__ data set
	- We can compare the predicted values for gymnastics participants
	  across the different response variables
	- Utilize a nonparametric test (like sign test or rank sum test)
		+ Adjust for multiple comparisons using
			- Bonferroni?
			- Holm Bonferroni (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holm%E2%80%93Bonferroni_method)
			 	In R: p.adjust(p, method = 'holm')
