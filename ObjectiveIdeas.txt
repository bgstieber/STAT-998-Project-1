(A) Missing Data Notes:

FA.length (not that important, Standing.Height is actually a better measurement)
ID: 13 - 1 missing value
	+ missing from first measurement, no big deal
ID: 23 - all missing
ID: 47 - all missing
ID: 156 - 1 missing value
	+ missing value for first measurement after menarche
	+ might not want to replace that one


Sub-head:
No missing data

For Radius responses:
ID: 13 - 1 missing value
	+ missing from first measurement, no big deal
ID: 23 - all missing
ID: 47 - all missing
ID: 156 - 1 missing value
	+ missing value for first measurement after menarche
	+ might not want to replace that one

For Hip responses:
ID: 19 - 1 missing value
	+ missing from eighth measurement - mean replace looks good
ID: 146 - 1 missing value (not missing for Femoral.Neck.BMC.Hip)
	+ missing value for first measurement after menarche
	+ might not want to replace that one

Spine BMC:
No missing data

(B) Approaches for Aim 1 - 3:

Considered using the lagged dependent variable, but the time between measurements
is not constant, so we shouldn't do that.

Aim 1: Investigate the contribution of gymnastics to the bone development for early adults
	- Fit the same model on each response variable
	- Variable of interest: dummy variable for gymnastics participation?
	- Investigate the coefficients for each model
		- Are they significant?
		- Are the predicted values higher for gymnastics?


Aim 2: Investigate the contribution of early gymnastics to the bone development in the late stage 
(after one quits the gymnastics)
	- I think we'll need to play with the data a bit here
		+ Maybe create an independent variable measuring time since they quit gymnastics?
		+ Categorical variable describing stage
			- In gym _or_ Quit gym _or_ Never in gym?

Subset the data (only NON and PERI)
Fit regression using Group_Label2 (Quit, Never, In Gymnastics)
If Never is base level, investigate beta1 (coefficient for In Gym) and beta2 (coefficient for Quit)
Also compare beta1 and beta2
Possibly interact with menarcheal age at DXA ?


Aim 3: Investigate whether the contributions of gymnastics are different to the development of bones
in different regions
	- Repeat analysis for part 1, but this time use centered and scaled
	  dependent variables (zero mean, unit variance)
	- we'll also need to make sure we fit each model on the __same__ data set
	- We can compare the predicted values for gymnastics participants
	  across the different response variables
	- Utilize a nonparametric test (like sign test or rank sum test)
		+ Adjust for multiple comparisons using
			- Bonferroni?
			- Holm Bonferroni (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holm%E2%80%93Bonferroni_method)
			 	In R: p.adjust(p, method = 'holm')
			- Dunn (https://www.jstor.org/stable/1266041)
