Experiment Questions:
1)	What is loading?
2)	How are mass, geometry and strength measured?
a.	What do benefits look like for mass, geometry, and strength?
3)	Skeletal site – where the bone is actually located?
4)	Is tissue type available in the data?

Objective Questions:
1)	How is bone development measured?
a.	Growth or changes in mineral content?
2)	What is meant by early and late in this data set?

Data Questions:
1)	Description sheet says there are 42 individuals, but there are 56 unique ID’s in the data set?
a.	Data entry error?
N   = 3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 
IDs = 3  6  3 15  8  5 13  3 

2)	For the radius measure, what is meant by 1/3?
3)	Is it unusual for distal radius and distal modulus to be nearly perfectly related?
a.	Distal Radius Third Area = Distal Modulus Third Radius ^ (1/3)
4)	NN Width Hip is strongly related to NN ED Hip as well
5)	For each objective which variable(s) are you mainly interested in?
6)	What is the index of structural strength? How is it measured / calculated?
7)	Are BMC all measured on the same units?
a.	It seems like there’s a large variance if so. What explains this?
8)	For physical activity variables is it safe to code NA values?
9)	Are there any appropriate transformations to be made to the response variables?
a.	E.g. UD BMC / UD Area ?	
10)	For individuals who "skipped" a measurement reading, would it be appropriate to replace that reading with the average measurement before and after the missed measurement?
11) 	Are times between measurements fairly constant?
