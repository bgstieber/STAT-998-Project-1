Questions 2

(1) Is there a rough age after menarcheal date where females stop maturing? Does growth stop or dramatically slow down at a certain time point?
	Also, is there an age range in which development is most rapid?

(2) How was peri / post determined?

(3) For aim 2: Is the appropriate comparison here between the non and peri groups?
	i.e. is it okay to perform the analysis on this subset?

(4) For aim 1: are you more interested in comparison gymnastics to non - gymnastics, or is it also important to compare whether the individual was in gymnastics at the time?

(5) Do you think participation in gymnastics alters bone development only while they're in gymnastics, or do some of the effects carry over? 
	If they do carry over, how long do you think these effects would last?

(6) 
We foundthat for most of the responses, the values tend to increase with age, and that the values tend to
be higher for those in gymnastics (after adjusting for other covariates).
However, for three respones (Narrow Neck Hip Buckling Ratio, Narrow Neck Width, Narrow Neck Endosteal Diameter)
all in the hip, the inverse was true. Does this surprise you?
